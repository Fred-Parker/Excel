# Bike Sales - (Excel) Analysis Project

My objective during this project was to create an **intuitive dashboard, with slicers, that highlighted key insights and areas for analysis from bike sales data**. This analysis enabled me to examine how factors such as region, commuting distance, education level, income, gender, and age, all influenced customers' bike purchasing history / habits.

<h2 id="key findings">Key Findings</h2>

It is my opinion that in this particular dataset of bike sales the data showing the demographic most likely to purchase a bike / multiple bikes was **not suprising**. Middle aged men who commute a reasonable cyclable distance to work (up to 1 mile) are often more likely to purchase fitness equipment - in part because they are targeted by fitness equipment marketing and designs more often than women. 

- Customers who purchased the **most** bikes were:
  - Male
  - Middle-aged  
  - From North America 
  - With commutes up to 1 mile  

- Customers with a **bachelor's degree**, **higher average incomes**, and **homeowners** tend to buy more bikes.

1. **Increase Sales in Other Age Groups**:  
   - Offer discounts to adolescents and the elderly as they typically have lower incomes compared to middle-aged customers.

2. **Boost Sales Among Women**:  
   - Focus marketing strategies on designing bikes that are more comfortable and visually appealing to women.  
   - Conduct surveys to understand women's preferences, such as colour, seat type, and accessories (e.g., baskets).

- **Excel**: 
  - EDA formulas such as `MIN()`, `MAX()`, `AVERAGE()`, `COUNT()` to describe bike sales.  
  - `IF` statements to categorise customers' age into groups (Adolescent, Middle Age, and Old).  
  - Pivot tables to summarise data and charts/sliders to visually display findings in an intuitive dashboard.

- The dataset consists of **1,000 records** containing details of customer demographics such as age, gender, marital status, level of education, and income.

<h2 id="methodology / approach">Methodology / Approach</h2>

1. **Data Cleaning**: 
   - Standardised the data, verified data types, and removed duplicates and irrelevant columns.  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: 
   - Used pivot tables to summarise and explore differences in bike purchase patterns by varying customer demographics.  

3. **Analysis**: 
   - Calculated average income and grouped customer data by gender to compare income and gender against bike purchases.  
   - Analysed bike number of purchases by age group and examined how commute distance to work influenced bike sales.  

4. **Visualisation**: 
   - Built a dashboard featuring charts and graphs to display key insights, making it simple to identify customer buying patterns and trends.  
   - Included slicers to filter data based on marital status, region, education, and homeownership (Yes/No).
